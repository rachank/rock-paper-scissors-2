        <p id="playinfo">Rock, paper scissors is a game that has its origins in China.
            Later, this game was transformed into its modern version while being played in Japan.
            <br>It uses the three symbols of rock, paper, and scissors and has three possible outcomes of win, loss, or
            tie.
            Rock beats scissors, as it blunts or breaks scissors, scissors beat paper, as it cuts paper,
            and paper beats rock, as it covers rock.
            <br>In our game against the Cunning Computer, you must click on one of the images of rock, paper, or
            scissors
            and the outcome will then be decided.<br>Good Luck!!
