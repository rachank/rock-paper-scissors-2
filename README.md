# Rock Paper Scissors Game

This is a rock paper scissors game. It is designed to be used by a single player to play against the computer. The user can choose one of three image choices of rock, paper or scissors and try to beat the computer which chooses at random. 

The rules of the game are the same as the original version. Rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock.

This game is targeted for people who have an interest in gaming. The additional graphics also incorrporate some more fun into the game. The game lists the rules and instructions at the beginning with a little historical fact on the game origins.

- The site is in black and white to better suit and emphasize the style of images it contains.
- A few brief historical facts are included on the game of Rock Paper Scissors for further insterest.
- Google Fonts was used to import the font family East Sea Dokdo, which was chosen and used throughout the entire site with Sans Sarif as the backup font. East Sea Dokdo compliments the style of the images in it's course texture and bold design.
- To increase the enjoyment of the game I designed some images to use as clickable images for rock, paper, and scissors with some fun facial expressions.

- Start images of rock, paper, and scissors
