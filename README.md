# Rock Paper Scissors Game

This is a rock paper scissors game. It is designed to be used by a single player to play against the computer. The user can choose one of three image choices of rock, paper or scissors and try to beat the computer which chooses at random. 

The rules of the game are the same as the original version. Rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock.

This game is targeted for people who have an interest in gaming. The additional graphics also incorrporate some more fun into the game. The game lists the rules and instructions at the beginning with a little historical fact on the game origins.
